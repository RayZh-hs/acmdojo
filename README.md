# ACM DOJO

The ACM Dojo project, forked from [pwn.college dojo](https://github.com/pwncollege/dojo). We have a huge refactor on the frontend, dojo creation logic, monitoring, reverse proxy, dependencies, and other stuff. So it IS NOT compatible for you to bring an existing pwn.college dojo instance config here.
